# Sign_Language_CNN_Prediction
The overall objective of the work is to develop model to preditc sign languages from the user. 

### Steps to Run 
1. Clone this repo 
2. You need to use Google Colab, set up your Google Colab with the folder names like image below

3. Put the function from this repository to the p3_deep_learning folder in your Google Collab: https://github.com/yuxiaohuang/teaching/blob/master/gwu/machine_learning_I/spring_2022/code/utilities/p3_deep_learning/pmlm_utilities_deep.ipynb
5. Set up your Kaggle Api
6. Run ML1_Final_Project.ipynb
7. Ignore the Predictions tap :)

### Machine Learning Algorithmss:
- Convolutional neural model.

### Description of files:
ML_Final_Project.ipynb: the files contains the data preprocessing, modeling and the user input to test our cnn model. 
ML1_ProjectPresentation_Group2.pptx: a powerpoint presentation of our insights, recommendations and models results.
